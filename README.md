This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

### How to Run
```yarn install```
```yarn test```

### Notes

1. I went with hooks for this application. That is my current default but I am familiar with the class style as well
2. As of now, I just have the basic jest test to see if it mounts.
